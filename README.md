Deepfake Detection - Project
Project Overview
This project aims to detect deepfake videos using machine learning techniques. By leveraging powerful neural networks, the goal is to identify manipulated visual content and discern whether a video is real or synthetic. The project is designed to be easily accessible and can be run in Google Colab, providing users with a simple interface for deepfake detection. It utilizes pre-trained models and includes scripts for video analysis, feature extraction, and classification.

Key Features
